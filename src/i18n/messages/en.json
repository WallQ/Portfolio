			"paragraph_2": "I enjoyed it, but only in 2020, when I dove into the Higher Professional Technical Course in Development for Web and Mobile Devices, that everything clicked. 😮 It was like opening a treasure chest full of new cool stuff rather than PHP, MySQL, and Bootstrap — only to realize there's a whole galaxy of tech out there! 🌌",
			"paragraph_3": "Right now, I'm completing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering and considering a Master's in Computer Science and Engineering in the future (maybe 🙃). I'm always on the lookout for new ways to flex my coding muscles and bring ideas to life whether through academic, personal, or professional projects.",
			"paragraph_4": "I continually pick up new skills and stay curious about solving new challenges. Whether it's in my sweet spot building a sleek web application or in my nightmare solving a tricky bug 💀, I'm all about delivering top-notch solutions that make an impact.",
			"paragraph_5": "So, if you're in need of an adaptable software engineer ready for new projects, let's connect! I'm eager to help turn your idea into reality. 😎"
